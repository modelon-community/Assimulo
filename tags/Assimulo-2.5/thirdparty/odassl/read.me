This zip-file contains the FORTRAN code ODASSL and all 
related subroutines.
ODASSL is an experimental code for solving overdetermined
differential-algebraic equation as they occur in mechanical 
multibody systems. (These systems become overdetermined
when considering position constraints *and* velocity constraints
*and* perhaps even accelaration constraints, see the example)

ODASSL is written on the basis of DASSL (Linda Petzold, Minnesota, USA)
The theoretical background of the extensions, the "O", can be found
in Führer/Leimkuhler: Numerical Solution of differential-algebraic equations
for constrained mechanical motion, Num.Math. 59, 55-69, 1991
and in a less compressed form in the textbook:
Eich-Soellner: Numerical Methods in Multibody Dynamics, Teubner 1998

The calling sequence of ODASSL is described in the heading comments
of ODASSL.F
A demonstration example and a sample driver can be found in DEMO.F .

I would like to emphasize that ODASSL is not a state-of-the-art
production code. It was written as a demonstration code to verify
a -at these days- new numerical approach.

ASSIMULO

Assimulo is a python based simulation package that allows for simulation both 
ordinary differential equations of the form f(t,y), (explicit problems) and 
differential algebraic equations of the form f(t,y,yd), (implicit problems). 
Assimulo currently supports Explicit Euler, adaptive Runge-Kutta of order 4 
and Runge-Kutta of order 4. It also wraps the popular SUNDIALS 
(https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html) solvers CVode 
(for explicit problems) and IDA (for implicit problems). CVode and IDA also 
supports discontinuous systems of the form f(t,y,sw) and f(t,y,yd,sw) with
event(root)-functions defined as g(t,y,sw) and g(t,y,yd,sw) where
sw should be fixed during the integration. The event(root)-functions are stored 
in event_fcn(t,y,(yd),sw).

The package comes with a Problem specifications class and subclasses corresponding 
to the different problem, Implicit_Problem and Explicit_Problem. To define and 
solve a problem, first import the solver of choice and the appropriate 
(Implicit/Explicit)_Problem class. Then define your function, f and if you'd like 
also set the starting values in the class, that is however just optional, you can 
just as easily pass them to the constructor of the solver as well. Then create your 
solver, set the attributes (method, absolute/relative tolerance etc.) and use 
the call to simulate.

For more information on how to solve a problem see examples.

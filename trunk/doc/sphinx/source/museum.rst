The Museum
=============

Assimulo includes an ODE solver museum. Integrators written in FORTRAN and C 
were developped at least since the mid-sixties. Many of those are hard to access 
others are only available as print-outs.

At the moment the Assimulo Museum includes

    * DASP3  (scan)
    * ODASSL
    
    wrapping is in preperation for
    
    * METAN1
    * EULEX
    * DIFFSUB
    * MEXAX
    
.. note::
   
   Codes marked by (scan) are reconstructed from a scan and an OCR process. They are tested but
   still they might include bugs due to the reconstruction process.
   
   All other codes are original and untouched.

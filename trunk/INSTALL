There are two setup files, each corresponding to a different level of setup.
If the package was downloaded as a release the cython part connecting Sundials
comes precompiled. So the only dependecies are shown below,

*REQUIREMENTS
-Python
-Numpy, Pylab

. To install just do a normal python installation, 'python setup.py install'.
To test the installation, browse to the tests folder and do a 'nosetests'.
Will require python-nosetests additionally.

If the package was download from the trac-site, the cython part is not precompiled.
This results in a few more dependencies,

*REQUIREMENTS
-Python
-Numpy, Pylab
-Cython
-Sundials-2.4

. To install you also have to edit the file setup_source.py, the variables 'incdirs',
and 'libdirs'. 'incdirs' should correspond to the include folder in the Sundials
installation and 'libdirs' should correspond to the lib folder in the Sundials
installation. Then just do a normal setup with the command:
"python setup_source.py install" and the package will be installed in your python 
dist-packages folder.

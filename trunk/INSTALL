There are two setup files, each corresponding to a different level of setup.

setup.py :

	In this package the .dll/.so comes precompiled so there is no need to
	have Sundials 2.4 or Cython installed. (Although the source .pyx files
	are included). Just do a normal setup with the command:
	"python setup.py install" and the package will be installed in your
	python dist-packages folder.

setup_source.py :
	
	You have to have Sundials 2.4 and Cython installed to be able to compile
	the source files. If you are on windows/mac or installed Sundials in a
	folder which is not the default, you have to edit the setup_source.py
	manually to where Sundials is installed. The variables to edit are
	"incdirs" and "libdirs". Then just do a normal setup with the command:
	"python setup_source.py install" and the package will be installed in
	your python dist-packages folder.

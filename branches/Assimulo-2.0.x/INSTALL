INSTALL
=======

There are two setup files, each corresponding to a different level of setup.

	setup.py
	setup_source.py
	
The idea with setup.py is to allow for pre-compiled binaries for Sundials and
the interface with Cython for Sundials. setup_source.py is intended for use 
when compiling everything from source.

If your package was downloaded as a platform specific release, use the setup.py
otherwise use setup_source.py. It's only for a platform specific release the
binary comes pre-compiled.


---------------
setup_source.py
---------------

*REQUIREMENTS
	-Python-2.6 (with headers)
	-Numpy, Pylab
	-Sundials-2.4.0
	-Cython

Installation is preformed using the command:

	'python setup_source.py install --sundials-home=/path/to/sundials'
	
The argument --sundials-home should point to where Sundials have been
installed. Assimulo is then installed under Python dist-packages. 
To test the installation, browse to the tests folder and do a 'nosetests'.
(The testing needs additionally python-nose)

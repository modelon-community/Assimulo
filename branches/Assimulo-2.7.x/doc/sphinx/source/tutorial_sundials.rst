Sundials
===============

Assimulo comes with some "own" solvers, while most solvers are solvers 
provided from elsewhere and wrapped into Assimulo.

The most central solver group are those collected in the 
`SUNDIALS <http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html>`_ Sundials package.

.. note::

    - The SUNDIALS code is left unchanged.
    - Not all of SUNDIALS parameters are currently lifted to Python.
    
See also the original  documentation `SUNDIALS <http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html>`_

Examples for the use of SUNDIALS within Assimulo are given in :download:`tutorialCVode.py` and

C                    DOUBLE PRECISION X,Y(N),F(N)

C                    IFCN=1: F(X,Y) MAY DEPEND ON X (NON-AUTONOMOUS)

C                 H=1.D0/(NORM OF F'), USUALLY 1.D-2 OR 1.D-3, IS GOOD.
C                 THIS CHOICE IS NOT VERY IMPORTANT, THE CODE QUICKLY

C                   ITOL=1: BOTH RTOL AND ATOL ARE VECTORS.

C      a contains the hessenberg matrix.  the multipliers
